# 2018JournalProject

## What this is

Paper organizers work better for me than electronic ones; as soon as I open my computer in the morning, I'm lost. The [Bullet Journal] fills a void that rigid preprinted layouts just can't fill: layouts that match exactly how I think about my day. YouTubers have taken the flexible and accessible system created by [Ryder Carroll] to a [whole new level][1] that honestly overwhelms and intimidates me. So I'm not going to doodle. I'm going to code.

## How it's organized: By Month and By Programming Language.

### Why Each Month?
I don't know what my perfect layouts will be. I don't know what my perfect process will be. It will evolve month by month, so the layouts generated each month will be a little bit tweaked. That said, I want a record of what I learned, what the layouts looked like, and I want to be able to refer back without trolling through git histories.

### Why multiple languages?
I love me some strongly typed languages, and previously to do microchip programming they are what you needed to use. Now you can throw any old language on a tiny tiny board, so I better get my skills up to date. With no preference for Python or Javascript, trying to do the same task in each seems at least interesting. I am not a pro at either language. As the year goes on I hope my form will get better. It's possible I may end up dropping one language in favor of the other or using them each for what they are "best" for.

Why SVG? Well, I want an [AxiDraw] and I need some justifications before I can bring another tool into the house.

## How to use the Repo

Missing layouts I probably am working with a draft done in Pages. They'll show up eventually.  Got to get some real work done.

### Python

Pretty straightforward for 2.7. This version of the language comes bundled in most operating systems.

- Get a file.
- Open the file.
- Change the variables so the right dates / content will be used.
- Open the directory (`cd DIRECTORY/LOCATION`) where the file lives in the command line
- Run the file (`python FILENAME.py`)

There are [fancier ways][2] to work with Python, but they aren't needed yet.

### Javascript

For the javascript code, since I'm using [Moment.js], I set up [node with homebrew][3], with some caveats if you run into [trouble with npm][4] (I have not). I'd only bother with the Javascript if node's already your thing.
